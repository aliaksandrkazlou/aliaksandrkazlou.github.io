\section{Data and Methods}

This section evaluates the effect of democracy on economic growth using the empirical approach of recent panel-data based studies. 
For this purpose, I rely on a regression commonly used in this literature:

I include country fixed effects in all specifications in order to remove the impact on economic growth of fixed country characteristics potentially correlated with democracy. 
I also include year fixed effects to remove any common global changes in democracy that may be correlated with GDP.

The main outcome variable, GDP per capita growth is from the World Development Indicators. 
As control variable I use GPD level, trade (exports plus imports), secondary enrollment, life expectancy, inflation,
government expenditures, physical capital, economic freedom, inequality, population size,
all from the World Development Indicators. 
I also create a measure of social unrest using Clio Infra (clioinfra.eu) indicating participation
