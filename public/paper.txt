\title{\LaTeX.js Showcase}

\begin{document}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
Value: ${value}
This document will show most of the features of \LaTeX.js while at the same time being a gentle introduction to \LaTeX.
In the appendix, the API as well as the format of custom macro definitions in JavaScript will be explained.
\end{abstract}


\section{Characters}

It is possible to input any UTF-8 character either directly or by character code
using one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\textbackslash symbol\{"00A9\}}: \symbol{"00A9}
\item \verb|\char"A9|: \char"A9
\item \verb|^^A9 or ^^^^00A9|: ^^A9 or ^^^^00A9
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\noindent
Special characters, like those:
\begin{center}
\$ \& \% \# \_ \{ \} \~{} \^{} \textbackslash % \< \>  \"   % TODO cannot be typeset
\end{center}
%
have to be escaped.

More than 200 symbols are accessible through macros. For instance: 30\,\textcelsius{} is
86\,\textdegree{}F. See also Section~\ref{sec:symbols}.



\section{Spaces and Comments}

Spaces and comments, of course, work just as they do in \LaTeX.
This is an            % stupid
% Better: instructive <----
example: Supercal%
ifragilist%
icexpialidocious

It does not matter whether you enter one or several     spaces after a word, it
will always be typeset as one space---unless you force several spaces, like\ \ now.

New \TeX users may miss whitespaces after a command. % renders wrong
Experienced \TeX{} users are \TeX perts, and know how to use whitespaces. % renders correct

Longer comments can be embedded in the \texttt{comment} environment:
This is another  \begin  {comment}
rather stupid,
but helpful
\end
{comment}
example for embedding comments in your document.
