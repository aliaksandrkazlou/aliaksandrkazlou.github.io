My name is Aliaksandr Kazlou. I do data science.

Iâ€™m interested in causal inference, its instersection with machine learning, human behavior, measurements, NLP and functional programming. I mostly work on human-level data, dealing with offline behavior such as geographic mobility, financial fraud, and modeling socio-demographic characteristics. I am fascinated with other problems with a noise ceiling, such as healthcare.
