My name is Aliaksandr Kazlou. I do data science.

Iâ€™m interested in causal inference, its instersection with machine learning, human behavior, and measurements. I mostly work on human-level data, dealing with offline behavior such as health, geographic mobility, financial fraud, and modeling socio-demographic characteristics.

You can email me at [avkazlou@gmail.com](mailto:avkazlou@gmail.com). I also have [Twtiiter](https://twitter.com/unfriendlydata) and [GitHub](https://github.com/aliaksandrkazlou).
